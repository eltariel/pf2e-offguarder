# PF2e Off-Guarder

Make things off-guard by hovering and pressing the O key.

Forked from [PF2e Keybind Menagerie](https://github.com/Drental/foundryvtt-pf2e-f-is-for-flatfooted) to make the default
keybind compatible with the Follow Me module - and to remove all the references to "Flat footed" ðŸ¤ª
